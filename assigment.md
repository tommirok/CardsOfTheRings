Familiarize yourself with API documentation at https://ringsdb.com and create a React app in which:

## - The user can fetch decks from the API one at a time with the deck's id.

## - After fetching the deck, present all hero cards from the deck.

## - When a user clicks on a card, the user can see the detailed information of the card.

## - In the detailed information view, create a modernized version for the card that is
##      constructed with HTML elements and uses css to place the values and text content
##      of the card similarly to the picture of the card.

## - Use TypeScript for coding. You can use other libraries you'd prefer and styling can also be
##      done by your preference. We hope that you try to show us your quality standards in the submission.
